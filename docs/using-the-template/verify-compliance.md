# Verify Compliance (10 sec)

Run `pipx run reuse lint`

1. If the output tells you the project is compliant, you can commit your license changes
2. If not, it will tell you which files are missing license or copyright statements. Simply return to [Set up the Licenses](./setup-license.md) and annotate the remaining files.
