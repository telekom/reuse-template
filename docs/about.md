## The Problem

When publishing open source software, not every file necessarily needs to be (or can be) under the same license and same copyright. 
- Code usually needs a different license than Documentation
- Some parts of code (Tests) may need different licenses than others
- Source files copied from other projects need to retain their licensing information
- ...

## The Solution: REUSE

The [REUSE Standard](https://reuse.software/) was established by the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) to make it easier to license Open Source Software. 

Specifically, it allows to specify the license information for each file, and provides tooling to make that as frictionless as possible.

## The Repo

[The REUSE Template](https://github.com/telekom/reuse-template) allows to quickly kickstart a project and make it ready for publishing as open source.

The template was created for Deutsche Telekom Projects, but is agnostic enough to be used by anyone.
